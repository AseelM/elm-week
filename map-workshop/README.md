# Map Workshop

getting to grips to using the wonderful `map` function in Elm

## Why?

We're used to using map in JS on arrays

```js
const myArray = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ].map(x => x * 2)
// myArray: [ 1, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]
```

Map is super useful! But it can do so much more in Elm!! Map is not just for lists

Work through the exercises in `MapExercises.elm` to make the tests pass in `tests/Main.elm`

If you get really stuck the solutions are in `Solutions.elm` but try not to look at these!

## Get up and running

1. Have `elm-test` installed globally (`npm install -g elm-test`)
2. Run `elm package install` in this directory
3. Run `elm package install` in the `tests` directory
4. To run the tests cd into this directory and run the command `elm-test`
