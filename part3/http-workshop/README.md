# Http code-along

# Objectives

* Become familiar with the step by step process required to make a Http request in Elm
* Understand how Elm handles failures in the outside world
* Start practicing how to decode incoming Json into Elm datatypes

## Steps

1. Read through https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/effects/, up to the Random section.
2. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate yourself a new token. Put it in a safe place!
3. Get ready for some code-along fun!

## Tips

* Be careful with Elm package versions. It is always safer to go to http://package.elm-lang.org/ and search on there rather than on google. Searching for them on google often takes you to an outdated version.

## Building

```bash
elm-live Main.elm --open --pushstate --output=elm.js
```
