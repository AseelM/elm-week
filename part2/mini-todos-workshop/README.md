# Mini Todos Workshop

Make your own simple todo app based on the types from the first section of https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/union_types.html


## Features

+ Can see a list of your todos
+ Can click on buttons to change which todos can be seen (`All`, `Completed` and `Active`)

Remember if you get stuck with the basic scaffold of an app, look back at the user input section https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/

## Stretch Goals

+ Add some extra visibility options (try adding something like `Urgent`)
+ Can you add a priority to your todos? How might you link this to the `Urgent` visibility?
+ Can you make each button go a different colour when it's selected?

## Getting started

1. cd into this directory
2. run `elm-reactor`
3. Add your solution to `Todo.elm`
4. Preview it at `localhost:8000/Todo.elm`

Only check the `Solution.elm` if you get stuck!
